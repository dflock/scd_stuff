 --------  ------------  --------------------------------
    2      pieces        fresh ginger root -- 1" cubes
                          -- coarsely chopped
      1/4  cup           water
      2/3  cup           water
    2 1/2  pounds        chicken breasts -- skinned
    5      cloves        garlic -- minced
    7      ounces        cilantro -- minced
      1/2                jalapeno -- minced
      1/4  teaspoon      cayenne
    2      teaspoons     cumin
    1      teaspoon      coriander
      1/2  teaspoon      turmeric
    1      teaspoon      salt
    2      tablespoons   lemon juice

 Put the ginger and 1/4 c. water   into a blender or processor. Blend until
 you have a paste.

 Put the oil in a wide, heavy, preferably nonstick pan over medium-high heat.
 When the oil is hot, put in as many chicken pieces as pan will hold in a
 single layer, and brown on both sides. Remove the chicken pieces with a
 slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Brown all the chicken pieces this way.

 Add the garlic to the hot oil. As soon as the pieces turn a medium-brown
 color, turn heat to medium and pour in the ginger paste. Stir-fry  it for a
 minute. Now add the fresh coriander, jalapeno, cayenne, cumin, coriander,
 turmeric, and salt. Stir and cook for a minute.

 Put in all the chicken pieces as well as any liquid that might have
 accumulated in the chicken bowl. Add 2/3 c. water and the lemon juice. Stir
 and bring to a boil. Cover tightly, turn heat to low, and cook for 15 minutes.

 Turn the chicken pieces over. Cover again and cook anoter 10 to 15 minutes or
 until the chicken is tender. If the sauce is too thin, uncover the pan and
 boil some of it away over a slightly higher heat.
