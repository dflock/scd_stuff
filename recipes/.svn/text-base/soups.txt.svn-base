Carrot Ginger Soup
Another mouth-watering recipe I recently made up:
In a large pot, saute a few cloves of garlic and a chopped onion 
                in olive oil, then add 2 cups water and about half of a butternut 
                squash (chopped). While this is cooking, add a pound of peeled, 
                chopped organic carrots and about fifteen thin slices of peeled 
                fresh ginger. Add salt to taste...some pepper...and a few shakes 
                of cinnamon (no more).
Allow to cook for at least twenty minutes. Then blend the entire 
                mixture in a food processor or blender until smooth.
If necessary add some boiled water while blending to get the desired 
                consistency, but be careful not to use too much water. This soup 
                is a puree...a thick and creamy soup.
Add a dab of butter to the bowl if you like, and mix before serving.
Delicieux!



tomatoes / eggplant Tomato Garlic Soup
("warms you from the inside out!")
(*and Grilled Eggplant)
Blanche twenty plum tomatoes. Set aside.
Lightly saute six cloves garlic in three Tablespoons olive oil. 
                Add pureed tomatoes to pan. Add a heaping tsp of dried basil (lots 
                of fresh basil in summer would be luscious). Saute for several 
                more minutes. Remove from pan. If you have them on hand, grilled, 
                peeled eggplant slices thicken the soup nicely. Add several slices 
                of the eggplant to the blend. Add salt and black pepper. 
                Puree with small amounts of water. This is a thick and hearty soup. 
                Serve sprinkled with parmesan cheese and fresh parsley.
*To prepare the eggplant, which also makes a nice appetizer the 
                night before the soup, slice eggplant a quarter inch thick, salt 
                lightly, let sit fifteen minutes, then pat with paper towels to 
                absorb excess water. Put in 375 F (200 C) oven for fifteen to 
                twenty minutes. Marinate for several hours in a drizzle of olive 
                oil, a few cloves of crushed garlic, and several tablespoons of 
                lemon juice. Sprinkle liberally with fresh parsley before serving. 
                Serve with freshly ground black pepper.
