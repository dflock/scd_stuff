		<h1>Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pork or Shrimp Cantonese-style</h1>

		<div class="left-column">
		<p>I have been a student of worldwide cooking for many years.
		Over those years, I have taken several courses, including two terms of
		Chinese Cooking in 1979 from a Chinese woman working her way through
		college by teaching cooking out of her family cookbook.  Certain
		fairly transparent changes were made to the recipes because of the
		difficulty in getting some of the authentic ingredients in the Midwest
		U.S.  in the seventies.  Even though those ingredients are easily
		obtainable at the bountiful quantity of Chinese grocery store across
		the country,  The need is not there.  A friend of mine who is the son
		of a licensed master chef from Korea and is, himself, now the owner
		his own of a Korean-Chinese restaurant (the family is Chinese, but
		lived in Korea before immigrating to the U.S.). has deemed my recipes
		as first quality.</p>

		<p>China is a large country with many regions, just like the U.S.  What
		is called Sweet and Sour varies a lot from region to region. Cantonese
		Sweet and Sour dishes are the most common and one the most popular
		dishes in Chinese restaurants.  Unfortunately, many of them are a too
		sweet, almost candied mess.  This Cantonese-style one a very close to
		what is made in Taiwan in the home of the woman that taught me Chinese
		cooking.  Only a couple of minor changes where made because the
		authentic ingredients were too hard to find the U.S. in 1979.</p>

			<tr class="odd">
				<td valign="top">C.</td>
				<td>4 tbsp. Vinegar<br />
					4 Tbsp. Catsup<br />
					4 Tbsp. Sugar<br />
					5 Tbsp. Cold Water<br />
					5 Tbsp. Pineapple Juice<br />

			<tr>
				<td valign="top">D.</td>
				<td>1/2 Cup Or More Corn Starch<br />
					4 Cups  Oil
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</p>
		<h2>Procedure</h2>
		<p>Pound pork or chicken with back of clever to tenderize, then
		cup it into 1" cubes.  Mix it with A and marinate at least 30 minute,
		or overnight.  Cut peppers (remove seeds and membranes) into 1"
		squares.  Peel carrot and slice diagonally into 1/8" thick slices.
		Peel onion and cut into 1" squares.  Drain pineapple.  Set each aside
		separately.  Mix C together in a bowl and set aside.  Heat 4 to 6 cups
		of oil to deep frying temperature in a deep skillet or wok.  While oil
		is heating, individually coat each piece of meat, removing excess
		marinade, with the 1/2 cup corn starch.  When oil is hot, add meat and
		cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes.  Remove meat from skillet
		and drain well.  Put 2 Tbsp. of oil in a clean wok and heat it up good
		and hot.  A carrot and cook 1 minute, then add onions for 2 minutes,
		green peppers for 1 minute and pineapple for 1 minute -- 5 minutes
		total.  Pour in C and cook until thickened.  Turn off heat.  Add meat
		and stir well.  Serve immediately.</p>

		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<p>Special Shrimp marinade:
		<ul>
			<li>1 tsp. salt,</li>
			<li>1 tsp. Chinese cooking wine,</li>
			<li>2 egg white,</li>
			<li>4 tsp. corn starch</li>
		</ul>
		* You can substitute arrowroot for corn starch for a more authentic
		dish. Reduce amounts use in recipe by half.<br />
		I sometimes make a special variation of this by combining two or three
		of the meats into Sweet and Sour Three Delights.</p>
