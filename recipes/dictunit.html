		The S I allows the sizes of units to be made bigger or smaller by the use of appropriate prefixes. For example, the electrical unit of a watt is not a big unit even in terms of ordinary household use, so it is generally used in terms of 1000 watts at a time. The prefix for 1000 is <i>kilo</i> so we use kilowatts[kW] as our unit of measurement. For makers of electricity, or bigger users such as industry, it is common to use megawatts[MW] or even gigawatts[GW].

		<a name="convention"><h2> <font color="#FF0000"> Conventions of Usage in the S I</font></h2>
		There are various rules laid down for the use of the SI and its units as well as some observations to be made that will help in its correct use.<table border=1 width=600 bgcolor=WHITE cellpadding=5><tr><td>
		<ul><li>Any unit may take only ONE prefix. For example 'millimillimetre' is incorrect and should be written as 'micrometre'.
		<li>Most prefixes which make a unit bigger are written in capital letters (M G T etc.), but when they make a unit smaller then lower case (m n p etc.) is used. Exceptions to this are the kilo [k] to avoid any possible confusion with kelvin [K]; hecto [h]; and deca [da] or [dk]
		<li>It will be noted that many units are eponymous, that is they are named after persons. This is always someone who was prominent in the early work done within the field in which the unit is used. Such a unit is written all in lower case (newton, volt, pascal etc.) when named in full, but starting with a capital letter (N V Pa etc.) when abbreviated. An exception to this rule is the litre which, if written as a lower case 'l' could be mistaken for a '1' (one) and so a capital 'L' is allowed as an alternative. It is intended that a single letter will be decided upon some time in the future when it becomes clear which letter is being favoured most in use.
		<li>Units written in abbreviated form are NEVER pluralised. So 'm' could always be either 'metre' or 'metres'. 'ms' would represent 'millisecond'.
		<li>An abbreviation (such as J N g Pa etc.) is NEVER followed by a full-stop unless it is the end of a sentence.
		<li>To make numbers easier to read they may be divided into groups of 3 separated by spaces (or half-spaces) but NOT commas.
		<li>The SI preferred way of showing a decimal fraction is to use a comma (123<b>,</b>456) to separate the whole number from its fractional part. The practice of using a point, as is common in English-speaking countries, is acceptable providing only that the point is placed ON the line of the bottom edge of the numbers (123<b>.</b>456) and NOT in the middle.</ul></td></tr></table></ Return to <a href="#top">the top</a> of this document<hr>
		<a name="history"><h2> <font color="#FF0000"> A Brief History of Measurement</font></h2>
		<table border=1 width=600 bgcolor=WHITE cellpadding=5><tr><td>
		One of the earliest types of measurement concerned that of length. These measurements were usually based on parts of the body. A well documented example (the first) is the Egyptian cubit which was derived from the length of the arm from the elbow to the outstretched finger tips. By 2500 BC this had been standardised in a royal master cubit made of black marble (about 52 cm). This cubit was divided into 28 digits (roughly a finger width) which could be further divided into fractional parts, the smallest of these being only just over a millimetre.
		<p>
		In England units of measurement were not properly standardised until the 13th century, though variations (and abuses) continued until long after that. For example, there were three different gallons (ale, wine and corn) up until 1824 when the gallon was standardised.
		<p>
		In the U S A the system of weights and measured first adopted was that of the English, though a few differences came in when decisions were made at the time of standardisation in 1836. For instance, the wine-gallon of 231 cubic inches was used instead of the English one (as defined in 1824) of about 277 cubic inches. The U S A also took as their standard of dry measure the old Winchester bushel of 2150<b>.</b>42 cubic inches, which gave a dry gallon of nearly 269 cubic inches.
		<p>
		Even as late as the middle of the 20th century there were some differences in UK and US measures which were nominally the same. The UK inch measured 2<b>.</b>53998 cm while the US inch was 2<b>.</b>540005 cm. Both were standardised at 2<b>.</b>54 cm in July 1959, though the U S continued to use 'their' value for several years in land surveying work - this too is slowly being metricated.
		<p>
		In France the metric system officially started in June 1799 with the declared intent of being 'For all people, for all time'. The unit of length was the metre which was defined as being one ten-millionth part of a quarter of the earth's circumference. The production of this standard required a very careful survey to be done which took several years. However, as more accurate instruments became available so the 'exactness' of the standard was called into question. Later efforts were directed at finding some absolute standard based on an observable physical phenomenon. Over two centuries this developed into the S I. So maybe their original slogan was more correct than anyone could have foreseen then.

		There have been three major Weights and Measures Acts in recent times (1963, 1976 and 1985) all gradually abolishing various units, as well re-defining the standards. All the Apothecaries' measures are now gone, and of the Troy measures, only the ounce remains. The legislation decreed that -
		<p>
		From the 1st October 1995, for economic, public health, public safety and administrative
		purposes, only metric units were to be allowed EXCEPT that -
		<ul>
		<li>pounds and ounces for weighing of goods sold from bulk
		<li>pints and fluid ounces for beer, cider, waters, lemonades and fruit juices in RETURNABLE containers
		<li>therms for gas supply
		<li>fathoms for marine navigation
		</ul>
		could be used until 31st December 1999.
		<p>
		The following could continue to be used WITHOUT time limit -
		<ul>
		<li>miles, yards, feet and inches for road traffic signs and related measurements of speed and distance
		<li>pints for dispensing draught beer and cider, and for milk in RETURNABLE containers
		<li>acres for land registration purposes
		<li>troy ounces for transactions in precious metals.
		</ul>
		Sports were exempt from all of this, but most of them have (voluntarily) changed their relevant regulations into statements of equivalent metric measures.

		That was how the legislation was framed. In common usage the 'old' units are still very apparent.</td></tr></table>

		<td><font face="ARIAL" size=5 color=#FF0000><b>Historical Perspectives on Metrication by Jim Humble</b><br /><font size=4 color=#000000>who was the last Director of the UK Metrication Board.<br /><br />
		<font face="ARIAL" size=3>
		The first parliamentary reference to metrication in the UK was 13th April <b>1790</b>. This was when parliamentarian Sir John Riggs Miller [Britain] and the Bishop of Autum, Prince Talleyrand [France] put to the British Parliament and French Assembly respectively, the proposition that the two countries should cooperate to equalise their weights and measures, by the joint introduction of the metric system.<br /><br />
		There was no immediate progress although there were many positive debates in the second half of the 19th Century. For example, 1st July <b>1863</b> the Bill for a compulsory change to the metric system was approved by 110 votes to 75 votes. Speakers argued many of the points we hear today. On the one hand supporters argued its logic and simplicity, savings in time and money, advantages to trade and education. Opponents stressed the undesirability of following the precedent of France and the problems of conversion for the illeducated and disadvantaged. However no specific cut-off dates were proposed.<br /><br />
		The following year, 9th March <b>1864</b>, the House of Lords debated a Bill to permit the use of metric weights and measures in trade. One supporter noted that Englishmen were notorious for liking old terms and old habits and he hoped that the new nomenclature would not be diverted by attempts at ridicule. He said the sound of the word 'metric' can be absurd to anyone but a fool who has never heard it before; but no more than a 'yard' to a man who has never heard of a 'yard' before.... !!! Parliament passed the Bill and this became the Metric Weights and Measures Act 1864.<br /><br />
		On the 24th February <b>1868</b> a parliamentary proposal to set Imperial cut-off dates was withdrawn on promise of a Royal Commission of enquiry. The Enquiry Report was positive, and on the 26th July <b>1871</b> Britain almost became a metric country.  The government lost the Bill to make metric compulsory after two years, by only 82 votes to 77 votes. An argument that might have influenced opponents was a plea that Britain would be "letting down America and our colonies" who had harmonised their systems with the ones in use in Britain. [NB At that time the American Congress had emulated Britain by allowing contracts in metric. A particularly strong USA advocate for metric was John Quincy Adams.]<br /><br />
		There were further debates, and near misses, in the UK Parliament in <b>1872</b> and <b>1896</b>, before a comprehensive debate [21st June - 6th August <b>1897</b>] concluded by legalising the use of metric for all purposes. There were no contrary votes. [NB This is the debate which most references indicate to be the genesis of metrication in the United Kingdom.]<br /><br />
		Metrication continued to be debated for the next 10 years. In <b>1904</b> The House of Lords unanimously voted to make metric compulsory after two years. It was claimed that the Austrian and German nations had successfully made metric compulsory with a changeover time of only "one week"!!!!! . The Government said they would not obstruct the proposal, but the Bill
		was never adopted in the Commons. Two similar debates in <b>1907</b> failed. By now, the Board of Trade was expressing some reservations, claiming that metrication had failed in France and that the agricultural labourer would never ask for 0.56825 of a litre of beer. The vote against compulsion rose to 150 votes to 118 votes. Conflicts in Europe put further political consideration of metrication out of mind until the publication of a Government White Paper on Weights and Measures 10th May <b>1951</b>.<br /><br />
		The <b>1951</b> White Paper was in fact the 28th Report put to Parliament during the preceeding 100 years. This latest report was in response to the the Hodgson Committee Report published in <b>1949</b>. Eventually we had the Weights and Measures Act <b>1963</b>; a long series of Parliamentary questions to Ministers and the Federation of British Industries [now the CBI] lobby in favour of metrication in <b>1965</b>.  These initiatives culminated with the creation of the Metrication Board in <b>1969</b> by Anthony Wedgewood Benn, Minister of Technology. The target date for completion was end <b>1975</b>. The transition to metrication and the role of the Board were given positive support and encouragement by Geoffrey Howe the responsible Minister of the new Government in <b>1972</b>. Indeed at that time, and until circa <b>1977/8</b>, there was good, sensible and
		steady progress which seemed to be supported by every section of society including, for example, the small retailers and the elderly as represented by Age Concern.<br /><br />
		Prepackaged food changed but the really difficult issue to emerge affected retailers of 'loose weight' products. They needed to be reassured there would be an agreed cut-off date for their transfer from Imperial to metric. The retail problem was that metric prices would always appear to be more expensive than their nearest Imperial equivalent.
		Voluntary transferees to metric found themselves commercially disadvantaged. This is because viz. 4 ozs is smaller than 125 g: one pound is smaller than 500 g and a pint is smaller than a litre. Prices are correspondingly lower. The issue of how best to explain the position to consumers dominated much of the Board's creative thinking.<br /><br />
		The product which brought all voluntary retail initiatives to a full stop was the experience of the floor covering and carpet retailers. Their <b>1975</b> change to sales by the sq. metre started well, but in <b>1977</b> one of the major High Street retailers found enormous commercial advantage in reverting to sales by the square yard. Consumers could not be persuaded to believe that goods costing, for example, 10 per square or 12 per square metre were virtually priced the same. Consumers bought, in very significant volume, the apparently cheaper priced imperial version. Metrication of carpet sales entered into full scale reverse and the Chambers of Trade and retail associations pressed for firm Government leadership i.e. compulsory cut-off.  With hindsight one of the Metrication Board jingles may have helped spread the 'carpet' misunderstanding. This was the jingle " a metre measures about three foot three, just a bit longer than a yard you see". Consumers understandably couldn't relate an e.g. 2 per square unit price difference with the Metrication Board's "just a bit longer". Then the political nerve began to fail.<br /><br />
		Board of Trade Ministers Shirley Williams, Alan Williams and later Roy Hattersley and John Fraser supported metrication. They seemed to recognise the setting of a cut-off date was unavoidable. They had had, by this time, the benefit of analysing the results of successful metric changes in all the Commonwealth countries. There was a wealth of
		information within the Department of Trade to show that a clear retail cut-off date was both desirable and inevitable....exactly as 19th Century parliamentarians had forseen. The necessary Order, drafted by the Board of Trade in <b>1978</b>, was agreed by a huge range of retail trade, industry, engineering, consumer, trade union, elderly person, sporting
		and educational organisations and..... the overwhelming number of parliamentarians. A small number of critics, in each political party, did voice opposition to the element of compulsion but this seemed to come from a relatively small minority within the Eurosceptic movement.<br /><br />
		However, the initiative was in the hands of Secretary of State for Trade, Roy Hattersley and a General Election was expected in <b>1979</b>.  There seemed to be weeks and weeks of "will he/ won't he" allow Parliament to vote for the Order giving the final Imperial cut-off. Almost every private test of opinion indicated the Order would command a substantial majority in Parliament. Although the Opposition sensed a weakness in the resolution of the Labour Government it was acknowledged that many conservative MPs had been career-long advocates for cut-off and would therefore be likely to favour the Government Order, or at least abstain. In the event, Roy Hattersley chose not to test opinion, not to allow the vote. He withdrew the draft Order. Speculation was that he judged the issue might lose some votes in the forthcoming election. Plenty of time to introduce Imperial cut-off Orders after a Labour victory. The junior Trade Minister, John Fraser, made his disgust and disappointment apparent... suggesting the actions of his Secretary of State would be seen as "gutless". Many shared that view. Labour lost the election anyway and Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister.<br /><br />
		One Conservative backbencher, Sally Oppenheim had been almost the lone but persistent critic of the metric programme. Ironically she was appointed junior Minister of Consumer Affairs at the DTI and then metrication was added to her portfolio. In letters to MP's and associations she made it clear <br />[a] she was not opposed the metrication in principle, <br />[b] metrication was not the result of Britain's accession to the EEC but <br />[c] she did object to measures which would compel people to adopt metric against their will. Proponents of metrication, trade and consumer organisations, officials and the Metrication Board explained and argued that a voluntary change at retail level was absolutely impossible...it could never happen. It was a recipe for confusion, waste and duplication. Government had to lead over the last hurdle. It did, it led backwards. In <b>1980</b> the Metrication Board was abolished.<br /><br />
		In truth the Metrication Board had little else to do. Every possible programme had been agreed, consumer information campaigns composed and there was nothing to do until or unless a date was fixed for the completion of the transition.  We little knew then the die was set for a further 20 years of waste, confusion and argument. Successive DTI Ministers did nothing to inform consumers or public opinion. They did nothing to refute the new 'big lie' namely, that Britain was being forced to change because of the European Commission. In fact, during the past 20 years most Commission Officials, European Politicians and businesses in Continental Europe 'couldn't have given a damn' whether Britain changed to the metric system or not. They seemed to quite like the idea of Britain shooting itself in its economic foot, by imposing upon itself the extra costs and waste of maintaining a dual system. For twenty years not one single British Minister has attempted to explain the advantages of metrication; been frank about the changes which had successfully taken place in the rest of the World or the fact that we had committed ourselves to become a metric nation long before we joined the European Community.
		Most tried to pretend or imply they were protecting our British culture from the European bully.<br /><br />

When the metric system was introduced in the 1790's the litre was intended to match up with the volume occupied by 1 kilogram of pure water at a specified pressure and temperature. As the ability to measure things got better (by 100 years later) they found that there was a mismatch between the kilogram and the litre. As a result of this they had to redefine the litre (in 1901) as being 1<b>.</b>000028 cubic decimetres. Very handy!<br />This nonsense was stopped in 1964 when it was ruled that the word "litre" may be employed as a special name for the cubic decimetre, with the additional recommendation that for really accurate work, to avoid any possible confusion, the litre should not be used.<br />Here the <b>litre</b> is taken as being a cubic decimetre.<table border=1 bgcolor=WHITE cellpadding=5><tr><td><pre>

		<a name="temp"><h2> <font color="#FF0000"> Temperature</font></h2>
		<p>There have been five main temperature scales, each one being named after the person who invented it.<br />
		G D FAHRENHEIT (1686-1736) a German physicist, in about 1714 proposed the first practical scale. He called the freezing-point of water 32 degrees (so as to avoid negative temperatures) and the boiling-point 212 degrees.<br />
		R A F de REAUMUR (1673-1757) A French entomologist, proposed a similar scale in 1730, but set the freezing-point at 0 degrees and the boiling-point at 80 degrees. This was used quite a bit but is now obsolete.<br />
		Anders CELSIUS (1701-1744) a Swedish astronomer, proposed the 100-degree scale (from 0 to 100) in 1742. This was widely adopted as the centigrade scale. But since grades and centigrades were also measures of angle, in 1947 it officially became the Celsius scale. Also, the S I system of units gives preference to naming units after people where possible.<br />
		William Thomson, 1st Lord KELVIN (1824-1907) a Scottish mathematician and physicist, worked with J P Joule - about 1862 - to produce an absolute scale of temperature based on laws of heat rather than the freezing/boiling-points of water. This work produced the idea of 'absolute zero', a temperature below which it was not possible to go. Its value is -273.15 degrees on the Celsius scale.<br />
		William J M RANKINE (1820-1872) a Scottish engineer and scientist, promoted the Kelvin scale in its Fahrenheit form, when the equivalent value of absolute zero is -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit.<br />
		Nowadays, while scientists use the KELVIN scale, the CELSIUS scale is the preferred scale in our everyday lives. However, the Fahrenheit scale is still widely used and there frequently is a need to be able to change from one to the other.<br />

		<a name="fuelconsumption"><h2> <font color="#FF0000"> Fuel Consumption</font> </h2>
		<p>Fuel consumption of any means of transport (car, aeroplane, ship etc.) that uses fuel is a measure giving the relationship between the distance travelled for an amount of fuel used. The most common example is the car where it is usually expressed (in English-speaking countries) in miles per gallon. <br />
		It could also be expressed in gallons per mile. However, for a car the latter method gives a rather small figure: 35 miles per gallon is about 0.0286 gallons per mile. In that case it would be better to give a figure for 100 miles, so it would be 2.86 gallons per 100 miles. That is the metric way of expressing fuel consumption - as <b>litres per 100 kilometres.</b> <br />
		From regular enquiries it appears that in real life people are using all sorts of ways of expressing their fuel consumption, so this section (unlike all the others) tries to cover as many ways as possible. All the values are given to an accuracy of 4 significant figures.<table border=1 bgcolor=WHITE cellpadding=5><tr><td><pre>

		Since power is a measure of the rate at which work is done, the underlying units are those of <a href="#energy">work or energy</a>, and that section should be looked at for explanations concerning the <b>calorie</b> and <b>Btu</b>. In this section the (IT) values have been used.<br />
		In this section it is the <b>horsepower</b> which provides confusion. Just like the calorie, it can take 5 different values, and these are identified as necessary by the addition of (boiler), (electric), (metric), (UK) and (water). Unlike the calorie <i>(whose 5 values are reasonably close to each other)</i>, the horsepower has 4 which are close and 1 (boiler) which is considerably different - it is about 13 times bigger than the others - but it seems to be very little used.<br />The S I unit of power is the <b>watt</b>. To change any of these other units of energy or work into their <b>equivalent values in watts</b> use the operation and conversion factor given. Those marked with # are <b>exact.</b> Other values are given to an appropriate degree of accuracy.

		In the <font color="FF0000"><b>UK</b></font COLOR> a very good place to make a start is the <a href="http://www.metric.org.uk"><b>Metrication Resource Site</b></a> run by Chris Keenan.<br />
		It covers just about everything one could want to know about metrication and, if not covered, gives links to sites where you might find it. Current state of progress, legislation, directives, arguments (for and against), conversions, and many other points of interest, all get a mention.
		<p>
		In the <font color="FF0000"><b>USA</b></font COLOR> the <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/SI"><b>National Institute of Standards and Technology</b></a> (NIST) is excellent, and there is no shortage of information concerning units and their conversion. There is even an excellent 86-page book on the subject (SP 811) which can be read on-line or downloaded and printed out - but note that <i>Adobe Acrobat Reader</i> is needed.<br />
		The <a href="http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/"><b>US Metric Association</b></a> is also a good starting point which provides a wealth of links to other suitable sites.<br />
		<p>

		<dt><b>Errors</b>
		<dd>Whilst every care has been taken in the compilation of this document, and many checks have been carried out, the possibility of an error is always present in a work like this and that must be borne in mind by all users. The author would be glad to be told of any errors detected.
		<dt><b>Accuracy</b>
		<dd>In a general dictionary like this it is impossible to know just what accuracy is needed by any particular user. Where the given value is an <b>exact</b> one then it has been signalled. In most cases other values are accurate to at least the number of significant figures shown. In some cases it might be more than that as trailing zeros have not been included.
		<dt><b>Presentation</b>
		<dd>The conversion factors have mainly been presented as multipliers, but exceptions to that have been made for two reasons. First, it is easier to convey the exact value 'divide by 60' rather than the approximation 'multiply by 0<b>.</b>0166667' and it is more likely to be keyed in without errors if a calculator is being used. Second, most calculators accept only 8 digits, which means that 'multiply by 0<b>.</b>000084666' will become '0<b>.</b>0000846' (3 significant figures) whereas 'divide by 11811' will give the result to 6 significant figures. The appearance of a '1' needs no operator but shows that the named unit is exactly equivalent to the standard unit.</td><td><br /></td>
		<td><dl>
		<dt><b>Inverse usage</b>
		<dd>In nearly all cases the conversion factors have been given to change 'non-standard' units into standard units of the SI. For those cases where it is necessary to do a conversion the other way it is only a matter of reversing the operation. For example to convert feet into metres you <b>multiply</b> by 0<b>.</b>3048 so, to convert metres into feet you <b>divide</b> by 0<b>.</b>3048. Following on from this it can be seen how conversions can be made between non-standard units, changing first into the standard unit and then back into the required unit.
		<dt><b>Author's Note</b>
		<dd>A guiding principle behind the writing and presentation of this document has been that of <b>clarity</b> for non-specialist readers. To that end I have been guilty of breaking "the rules" in a few places. I am sorry that these transgressions may offend some readers but I have done so in the belief that it will be a little bit easier for many, and also help the flow of a continuous narrative.<br />
		This dictionary is not meant to be encyclopaedic in its coverage, and there are many many more units which are not touched upon, but it is hoped that all 'ordinary' needs are covered. The many references to other sources, both in books and on-line should take care of anything beyond that.<br />
